                                It is very important to check that you inserted the correct address of the coin and to check the status of the coin before making a withdrawal. In order to assure that your withdrawal will arrive to its destination and you won’t lose your funds, please make sure that you withdraw only when the green ticket symbol stating “All OK!” is enabled next to the coin.A withdrawal that is confirmed through the email is irretrievable.
